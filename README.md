### Requirements

* Login to the app via email and password
* Restrict access to valid a User
* Once logged in show the details of the user on the page
* Authorized users can check their account balance
* Allow the user to change their details
* lowdb (DB) -> https://github.com/typicode/lowdb
* node.js (v0.10.x) -> http://nodejs.org/ 

### Bonus Points

* Fully responsive UI
* Unit Tests of the API
* Functional Tests of the UI
